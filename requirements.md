# EcoWipe System Requirements
Team: BHARAT DEFENDERS

## Introduction
EcoWipe addresses the trust gap in electronic device recycling by guaranteeing irreversible data deletion and providing verifiable audit proof.

## Problem Statement
Users cannot confirm that discarded devices are free of recoverable data. Existing wiping tools lack transparency, verification standards, and tamper-proof audit capability, creating privacy and compliance risks.

## Objectives
- Guarantee irreversible data erasure
- Generate tamper-proof verification certificates
- Provide audit-ready logs
- Enable secure device reuse
- Deliver a hackathon-ready prototype

## Functional Requirements

User Management
- Secure authentication
- Role-based access control

Device Registration
- Device metadata capture
- Automated protocol assignment

Secure Wipe Execution
- Hardware-level wipe support
- Offline tamper-resistant execution

Verification
- Cryptographic wipe validation
- Certificate generation

Audit Logging
- Immutable records
- Secure storage
- Downloadable proof

API Automation
- REST endpoints
- Real-time status tracking

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Secure communication
- Compliance readiness
- Scalable architecture
- Efficient resource usage
- Reliable verification workflow

## Technology Requirements
- React frontend
- Node.js backend
- MongoDB database
- OAuth/Firebase authentication
- Hardware wipe protocols

## Constraints (Hackathon Scope)
- Lightweight prototype
- Open-source tools
- Cloud-based execution
- Demonstration-focused workflow

## Estimated Implementation Cost
Monthly prototype operation: ₹15,000–₹30,000  
One-time setup: ₹15,000–₹30,000  

## Expected Outcomes
- Trust-driven recycling
- Verifiable data sanitization
- Privacy protection
- Increased hardware reuse
- Environmental and economic benefits
